I am currently a junior at Los Osos High School, and it is an absolute honor to be able to lead this wonderful group through our initiatives in making a change for our families and members that have invisible disabilities! After witnessing my family members and friends go through their own struggles with disabilities, our goal evolved into providing awareness, reducing the stigma, and contributing resources to individuals that need the most support. So far, we have hit key milestones within our timeline and we hope to continue this journey and bring substantial impacts to our communities. With the help of our partnership with EasterSeals, we have been connecting members with opportunities for certified treatments and therapies as well as inclusion. We cannot wait to see the future of this committee and we sincerely thank you for the support!</p>

I love spreading important messages through my passion for graphic design. My favorite post that I made is the 4-group collab, where Lead 4 Change and 3 other organizations teamed up for an online event discussing how music helps our brains. I also really enjoy drawing and making posters. Through Lead 4 Change, I was able to express my creativity in a way that would positively impact the community.</p>

Through video editing and media production, I help increase visibility and engagement for our initiatives.

I am a freshman at Los Osos High School with a strong interest in the medical field, and in my free time, I love baking, shopping, and spending time with my family. I was so excited to be a part of this journey in spreading awareness for invisible disabilities, especially because I have firsthand experienced navigating one. I understand how it feels to appear 'normal' while being heavily impacted in ways others may not see, which is why I chose Lead4Change to be a part of in advocating for those who feel invisible and help make things easier for them, just as I wish someone had done for me. Working with this team on our events has been an incredible experience, and I can’t wait to see how far we can take this positive impact in our community!</p>

I applied to this program because I want to continue making a positive impact, advocating for those whose struggles may not be obvious, and growing as a compassionate leader.
