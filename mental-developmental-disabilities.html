                        <h2>Research on Disabilities — Information Page</h2>
                        <p><strong>Based on World Health Organization and the Invisible Disabilities Association</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>The Majority are Hidden:</strong> Recent global estimates indicate that 70% to 80% of all disabilities are invisible.</p>
                        <p><strong>The 1-in-6 Reality:</strong> Globally, approximately 1 in 6 people live with a disability, meaning over 1 billion individuals navigate non-visible conditions such as chronic pain, neurodivergence, or mental health disorders.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Financial Well-Being Gap:</strong> As of early 2025, households with a disability are 21 percentage points less likely to report being financially "okay" compared to non-disabled households.</p>

                        <h2>Marginalization and Stigma in 2025</h2>
                        <p><strong>Marginalization Risks:</strong> As of June 2025, the WHO Disability Health Equity Initiative highlights that persons with disabilities remain among the most marginalized globally, facing unfair health inequities such as poorer health outcomes and earlier deaths.</p>
                        <p><strong>The "Look Good" Bias:</strong> Immersion-based research in 2025 confirmed that individuals with invisible disabilities consistently face stronger negative attitudes and avoidance tendencies than those with visible disabilities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stigma of Disclosure:</strong> Even in 2025, workplace research shows that nearly half of employees with invisible disabilities choose not to disclose their conditions due to fears of scrutiny or being perceived as less capable.</p>

                        <h2>Why Our Work Matters</h2>
                        <p>While the world remains blind to these challenges, we provide the financial lifelines that keep families afloat and the advocacy platforms that turn silence into social change. We don’t just ask the world to “see” invisible disabilities, we demand that they are supported because a challenge you can’t see shouldn’t be a challenge you face alone.</p>
